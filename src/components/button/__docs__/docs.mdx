```typescript

```

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. Do not use buttons for navigation, instead use links.

Button labels should be clear and predictable. Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button.
To provide enough context, use the {verb} + {noun} format except in the case of common actions like “Done”, “Close”,
“Cancel”, “Add”, or “Delete”.

There are exceptions to this rule for situations in which button length could cause problems in compact UIs or
negatively impact translation, but the {verb} + {noun} formula is still best practice.

## Icon Button

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--icon-basic" />
</Canvas>

```typescript
import {Button} from '@frontapp/ui-kit';
```

An icon button is not a different component but instead is rendered when the `type` of the button is set to:

- `icon`
- `icon-danger`

We will ignore all the content of the button except for the first `Icon` passed in.

# Button Content

```typescript
import {ButtonContent} from '@frontapp/ui-kit';
```

`ButtonContent` is a component that wraps the content of a button and renders it in the correct grid area.
You will not need to use this component as the button automatically wraps the content with this.

# Button Content Icon

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--icon-content-basic" />
</Canvas>

```typescript
import {ButtonContentIcon} from '@frontapp/ui-kit';
```

`ButtonContentIcon` is used to easily align icons with the two supported positions we have.
We will ignore all the content of the `ButtonContentIcon` except for the first `Icon` passed in.

#### Note: Use `Icon` when `type` is set to `icon` or `icon-danger`.

# Button Group

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--group-basic" />
</Canvas>

```typescript
import {ButtonGroup} from '@frontapp/ui-kit';
```

`ButtonGroup` groups buttons together with a standard spacing. You can align the buttons on either the
`left` or `right` of the group.

# Stories

## Sizes

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--sizes" />
</Canvas>

Front supports 3 different button sizes: Small, medium and large. Sizes are defined by difference in height, padding, and label scale.

<br />

## Variants

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--variants" />
</Canvas>

Front uses 3 button variants which include the following: primary, secondary and tertiary.

Each button variant has a unique purpose based on several variables including emphasis, grouping and effect.

- `primary`: Main call to action. A container (e.g. a pane, a modal, etc.) should have only one primary button.
- `secondary`: Secondary actions. Typically in conjuction with a primary.
- `tertiary`: For less prominent actions; tertiary buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary or secondary button when there are multiple calls to action.
- `primary-danger`: When the primary action has a destructive effect on the user's data.
- `secondary-danger`: When the secondary action(s) have a destructive effect on the user's data.
