## Select allowing Multiple Options

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-select--multi" />
</Canvas>

This story shows how you would support selecting multiple options in the select. Note that selecting an option
no longer closes the dropdown when in multi select mode.

You will also notice that when the items overflow, we will automatically just hide the overflowing items and show
a `+X` for the amount of items that were overflowing.
