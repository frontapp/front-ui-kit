# Accordion

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--basic" />
</Canvas>

The `Accordion` component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. 
The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.

Accordions can make information processing and discovering more effective. However, it does hide content from users and 
it's important to account for a user not noticing or reading all of the included content. If a user is likely to read 
all of the content then don't use an accordion as it adds the burden of an extra click.

# AccordionSection

The `AccordionSection` component is required to use the `Accordion` component. It wraps all the content you would like to render for
the section with no limiations of what can be rendered within it.

# Stories

### Basic Story

In this example, we are using the defaults for the accordion. This example shows what it would be like to render settings where 
a user can configure an item's properties by selecting multiple fields to show/hide. This example only allows a single section to
be open at a time.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Multi Expand Story

In this example, it is almost exactly the same as the Basic example except you can expand multiple sections at a time.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-accordion--multi" />
