# Form Field

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-field--basic" />
</Canvas>

The `FormField` component is a wrapper component that can render anything within it. Typically
you would use this to render `Input`'s in a form. 

<br />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={FormField} />

<hr /><hr />

# Stories

## Erred Form Field

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-field--erred" />
</Canvas>

When you set the `isErred` on the form field, it will automatically set the `isErred` for any children that supports it.

<br />

## Required Form Field

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-field--required" />
</Canvas>

When you set the `isRequired` we will mark it as required. It will still be up to you to validate they attach a value as
this component is a purely visual one.

<br />

## Multiple Form Fields

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-form-field--multiple" />
</Canvas>

The above is a simple example of multiple `FormField`'s. When there are more than 1 in a container component we will automatically
add some margin between the fields.
