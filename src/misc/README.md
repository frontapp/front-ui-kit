### Purpose

The purpose of the `/misc` directory is to have a single path where we can exporting the following type
of components:

- Plugin Specific Components
- Pre-built Complex components

These components will have a strict interface to them, that may not fit all use-cases. If you find a component
that doesn't work exactly as you would like, they should all be built from smaller components in the library.
