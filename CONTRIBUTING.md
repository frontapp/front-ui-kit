# Definition of Done
==========

Each component created will have to meet the following requirements to be marked as done. 
[This will be initially used only by Front developers while we build the starter components for this project. As this project is open for other developers, this set of requirements will likely grow.]

1. Stories in Storybook: Each component's story should test the range of props supported by the component.
2. Approved by at least one other developer.
3. Documentation for the component is created / updated. 
4.
